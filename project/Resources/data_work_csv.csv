Teamwork over one's work
Problem Solving Centric","Job Scope
You’ll be working on all aspects of our product and platform: from front-end visualizations, implementing scalable, data-heavy features, helping customers with their complex SQL, to managing our servers that processed thousands of heavy jobs everyday.

Build complex and interactive data delivery platform using HTML5, JavaScript; build reusable front-end JS/HTML components.

Build an Excel-like Pivot Table interface for slicing and dicing of data

What We Look For In You

Problem Solving: You don’t just write code based on requirements, you debate the requirements with us.
Coding: You write good code, you’ve written code that handle a lot of load, and you enjoy optimizing and refactoring your code to make it faster
Culture & Mindset: You’re a team player; you understand how it’s like working for a startup – doing anything and everything needed (from writing blog posts, to help customers with their data problem)
Tech Stack: we use Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, Vue.js, ES6, TypeScript and a lot of SQLs. It’s great if you know these, but it’s not a big deal. We’re confident you’ll pick these up quickly on the job.
Basically you will not just implement features based on a task list. We need your original ideas, creativity and critical thinking skills to help us build a great data platform.","Our Engineering Philosophy
Problem Solving Centric‍
We are not obsessed with any particular technology. We believe cool technologies might not get the job done, the right technologies do. We currently use Ruby, Node.js, VueJS with PostgreSQL and Redis but not afraid to try new things. We invented our own job scheduling system when we found nothing fit our needs.

‍Quality Over Quantity
We think performance and code quality should not be an afterthought. We favor code refactoring over adding new functionality. We focus on test-driven development, short-cycle deployment. We make sure our code is highly readable and modular with thorough technical documentations and proper design patterns.

Metrics-Driven Engineering
When it comes to engineering performance, we don't feel, we know. We don't just rely on intuitions, but let the numbers speak for itself. We have logging and monitoring properly set up. We know how fast (or slow) our site is, and how much improvements we've made compared to last week.

Our Engineering Culture
We don’t fancy free food or ping pong table, we focus on building an environment where our engineers can be productive and concentrate on solving good problems
Our engineers own the product from end to end. They are involved in and get to speak directly with the customers to understand how they’re using it
We don’t write bad code to rush for the deadline. We prefer spending more time refactoring the code over shipping bad code
Interview Process 
- Round 1: A short chat with HR (Short chat to introduce Holistics, our product, discuss to understand your skills and experiences)

- Round 2: Technical interview with Engineering team

- Round 3: Do take-home assignment (offline - deadline 3days, will be sent after Round 2)
